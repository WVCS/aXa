        <h1>What Is Mental Health?</h1>
        <p>Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.</p>

      <p class="card-text">My name is Zachary Joseph Marek. I am currently a senior at Westview High School. When I was in 8th grade, I began to struggle with suicidal thoughts and depression after losing my best friend to suicide. After that I had really bad depression and I attempted to take my own life. Shortly after, my cousin commited suicide. I still struggle with anxiety and depression to this day with occasional suicidal thoughts. I sometimes leave people on read because I don’t know how to respond and I am afraid of saying the wrong thing. Mental health wasn’t really talked about in the past but my mom has been trying to be more supportive ever since she found out how much depression really was affecting me. Even though she doesn’t always know how to respond, she at least tries to listen to my problems. Westview has a very encouraging and open campus that allows people to open up to others. The biggest thing that has helped with coping is talking to other people. I began to go to a therapist after going through a rough time. Friends and family are my biggest supporters. “The darkest nights make the brightest stars”. This quote has stuck with me for most of my life. No matter what you’re going through, even if you can’t see any light, you just gotta keep going. Because once you’re out of the darkness, you realize how beautiful the light truly can be.</p>

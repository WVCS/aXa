      <p class style="font-size:150%;"="card-text">"My name is Zachary Joseph Marek. I am currently a senior at Westview High School. When I was in 8th grade, I began to struggle with suicidal thoughts and depression after losing my best friend to suicide. After that I had really bad depression and I attempted to take my own life. Shortly after, my cousin commited suicide. I still struggle with anxiety and depression to this day with occasional suicidal thoughts. I sometimes leave people on read because I don’t know how to respond and I am afraid of saying the wrong thing. Mental health wasn’t really talked about in the past but my mom has been trying to be more supportive ever since she found out how much depression really was affecting me. Even though she doesn’t always know how to respond, she at least tries to listen to my problems. Westview has a very encouraging and open campus that allows people to open up to others. The biggest thing that has helped with coping is talking to other people. I began to go to a therapist after going through a rough time. Friends and family are my biggest supporters. “The darkest nights make the brightest stars”. This quote has stuck with me for most of my life. No matter what you’re going through, even if you can’t see any light, you just gotta keep going. Because once you’re out of the darkness, you realize how beautiful the light truly can be."</p>

Facts About Depression
 
What is depression?

Everyone gets the blues now and then, but when there is little joy or pleasure after visiting with friends or after seeing a good movie, there may be a more serious problem. A depressed mood that stays around for a while, without letting up, can change the way a person thinks or feels. Doctors call this “clinical depression.”

Depression is a common, serious illness and not a personal weakness. Depression can happen to anyone, at any age, and to people of any race or ethnic group. It is never a “normal” part of life. Depression, which is treatable, can come from chemical imbalances in the brain, hormonal changes, medications or things going on in your life.

Women suffer from depression twice as often as men. One out of four women may have depression sometime during their lifetime. Many people suffer with depression but do not seek help.

What are the symptoms of depression?

If you experience five or more of the following symptoms and they last for more than two weeks, or if the symptoms interfere with your daily routine, see a doctor or a qualified mental health professional. A physical examination to rule out other illnesses may be recommended.

a persistent sad, anxious or “empty” mood
sleeping too little or too much
reduced appetite and weight loss, or increased appetite and weight gain
loss of interest or lack of pleasure in activities once enjoyed, including sex
restlessness or irritability
persistent physical symptoms that don't respond to treatment (such as headaches, chronic pain, or constipation and other digestive disorders)
difficulty concentrating, remembering or making decisions
fatigue or loss of energy
feeling guilty, hopeless or worthless
thoughts of death or suicide
What causes depression?

Many things can lead to clinical depression. Following are factors that can contribute to the illness:

Biological - People with depression may have too little or too much of certain brain chemicals. Changes in these brain chemicals may cause or play a role in clinical depression.
Cognitive - People with negative thinking and low self-esteem are more likely to develop clinical depression.
Gender - Women experience clinical depression nearly twice as often as men. The reasons for this are still not understood, but may include hormonal changes women go through during menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth and menopause. Other reasons may include the stress caused by the many responsibilities that women have.
Co-occurrence - Depression is more likely to occur along with certain illnesses, such as heart disease, cancer, Parkinson’s disease, diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease and hormonal disorders.
Medications - Side effects of some medications can bring about depression.
Genetic- A family history of clinical depression increases the risk for developing the illness.
Situational - Difficult life events, including divorce, financial problems or the death of a loved one can contribute to clinical depression.
